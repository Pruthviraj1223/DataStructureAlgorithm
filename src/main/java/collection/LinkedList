1. List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();

2. LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();

3. Deque<String> list = new LinkedList<>();



1st and 2nd,3rd is different.

1st one is similar to ArrayList. singly linked list.

2nd , 3rd is doubly linked list.

method in list is already here.
below method is extra in case of DLL.

Remember : LinkedList have method of accessing,removing,adding element from index. (add,remove,get) which iterates till index.

addFirst            // void
addLast
offerFirst          // return boolean
offerLast
peekFirst
peekLast
getFirst
getLast
pollFirst           // if no element then return null
pollLast
removeFirst         // if no element then exception will be thrown , NoSuchElement
removeLast
