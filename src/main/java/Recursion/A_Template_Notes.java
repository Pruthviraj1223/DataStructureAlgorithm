        // This needs to be understood before you solve any recursion or backtracking question

        // this is not simple recursion , this is recursion with backtracking

        // To debug or understand this solution always put sout statement at pre- and post-operation.

        // Before solving any question always visualize the whole process

        // Following all question will have similar patterns:


        // 1. starting of recursion function with base condition

        // 2. traverse on the whole array or string

        // 3. In loop, you first add values in any data structure

        // 4. then recursively call function (with index or index + 1, it depends on use case)

        // 5. once loop gets completed or base condition matches we will do post operations on the data structure or any variable

        // 6. post operations means backtracking


        // NOTE : for debugging purpose always put sout statement before 4th step and after 6 step mentioned above.

        // Along with code always understand the recursion tree


        // 1st solve subset then combination then permutation of string

        // recursion tree is important. Tree is already drawn in notebook.

        // you can read, and you also create again for better understanding
